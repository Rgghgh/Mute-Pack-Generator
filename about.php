		<b>What is this?</b> Mute Pack Generator creates a custom resource pack that will mute the sounds you choose to mute.
		For example, You can choose to mute the villager sounds, or nether portal sounds. <br> 
		<br>
		<b>How does it work?</b> Select the sounds you want to mute, Click "Download", Set the downloaded pack as your resource pack,
		Then play and enjoy the silence!<br>
		<br>
		<b>Can I keep using the resource packs I use now?</b> Yes! Mute Pack Generator packs contain sound files only. They do not change any textures.
		This means you can use other resource packs together with the mute pack.<br>
		<br>
		<b>How the app Works?</b> PHP, MySQL, Javascript (jQuery).
